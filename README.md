A tool for trademarking and unique imprinting.

The premise is simple. 

Using the anvil, name a tool, item, book, whatever. Give it a string of 10 characters (configurable!)
as its name, like `1kZ9dlkPPe`. Then take it to an enchanting table, and right-click the table with 
the item. That seemingly random string of letters and numbers will be magically transformed into a unique,
colored name, at the small cost of 10XP (configurable!). It will have between one and three (configurable!)
words as a result. The item will also never be able to be renamed, ever again. 

That's about it! Enjoy your trademarks, uniquely branded products, and the joy of discovering new names.
